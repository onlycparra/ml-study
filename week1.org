* Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning
/"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."/ (Arthur Samuel)
** Supervised Learning
Algorithms that achieves mappings \(x \rightarrow y\) by learning from many "correct examples".
- spam filter: email -> spam
- speech recog: audio -> text transcript
- translator: english -> spanish
- online advertisement: ad + user info -> click
- self-driving car: image, radar, etc -> position of other cars
- visual inspection: image of product -> defect?
*** Regression
- Find a function.
- Predict a number.
- From infinitely many posibilities, such as the price of a house.

*** Classification
- Predicts categories.
- From small set of possible categories like "malignant" or "benign".

** Unsupervised Learning
Algorithms that discover the structure or pattern of the given data.
- Clustering algorithms: group similar points together.

- Anomaly detection: find unusual data points.
- Dimensionality reduction: Discover relevant features and "compress" the input dataset.

** Reinforcement Learning
Not yet discussed...
* Regression Model
** Linear Regression Model
- This just fitting a straight line on the data. It is probably the most used algorithm to predict a numeric value.
- In this case, the input contains "one feature".
*** Glossary:
- \(x\) :: Feature. Variable that describes some characteristics of the input.
- \(y\) :: Target. Variable from which we have some examples, and want to ultimately predict for new sets of features.
- \(m\) :: Number of training examples.
- \((x,y)\) :: A single training example.
- \((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\) :: The \(i^\text{th}\) training example in the dataset.
- \(f\) or \(h\) ::
