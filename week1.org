* Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning
/"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."/ (Arthur Samuel)
** Supervised Learning
Algorithms that achieves mappings \(x \rightarrow y\) by learning from many "correct examples".
- spam filter: email -> spam
- speech recog: audio -> text transcript
- translator: english -> spanish
- online advertisement: ad + user info -> click
- self-driving car: image, radar, etc -> position of other cars
- visual inspection: image of product -> defect?
*** Regression
- Find a function.
- Predict a number.
- From infinitely many posibilities.
